**Project: Bus Reservation System**

**Description:** Designed and implemented a Java-based console application to automate the process of bus ticket booking and management. The system allows passengers to view bus details, check availability, reserve seats, and track bus capacities.

**Key Features:**

1) Display bus details (bus number, AC availability, seating capacity).

2) Passenger seat reservation with real-time availability check.

3) Maintain booking records with travel date and passenger details.

4) Display initial and updated bus capacities after each booking.

**Technical Implementation:**

1) Core Java with JDBC for database connectivity to MySQL.

2) Applied DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for separation of concerns between business logic and database operations.

3) Used PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection and handle dynamic queries.

4) Modularized with classes like BusDAO, BookingDAO, DbConnection, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

**Tools & Technologies:** Core Java, JDBC, MySQL, Eclipse IDE.
